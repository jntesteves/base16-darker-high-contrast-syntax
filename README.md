# Base16 Darker High Contrast Syntax theme

Syntax theme for Atom loosely based off of the [Base16](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/) dark palette.
This theme was forked from [Base16 Tomorrow Dark](https://github.com/atom/base16-tomorrow-dark-theme) and will be kept updated with future changes to it.
